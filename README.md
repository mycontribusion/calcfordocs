# CalcForDocs

## Overview

**CalcForDocs** is an offline-first, web-based clinical decision support platform designed to provide fast, reliable medical calculators for frontline healthcare workers, especially in low-resource and low-connectivity settings.

The platform removes common access barriers by working on **any device with a web browser**, requiring **no app store installation**, **no user accounts**, and **no continuous internet connection**.

CalcForDocs is built and maintained by a practicing medical doctor, ensuring clinical relevance and real-world usability.

## The Problem

Healthcare workers in many settings face significant barriers when accessing clinical decision tools:

* Most medical apps are **device-specific**, excluding clinicians without certain smartphones or operating systems
* Many medical websites are **internet-dependent**, making them unreliable in areas with poor connectivity
* Existing tools often require **navigating through multiple pages**, slowing down urgent bedside decisions

These limitations contribute to delays, calculation errors, and reduced adherence to evidence-based care—particularly in underserved healthcare systems.

---

## The Solution

CalcForDocs addresses these challenges by providing:

* A **single-page, fast-loading interface** optimized for bedside use
* **Offline functionality** using Progressive Web App (PWA) technology
* **Device-agnostic access** via any modern web browser
* **No logins, subscriptions, or payments**

The platform is intentionally lightweight and resilient, designed to function in environments where infrastructure is limited.
